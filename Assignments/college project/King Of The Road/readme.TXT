			TROUBLESHOOTING Q&A

Q:	When I start the game, a banner appears:
        "A required .DLL file, XXXXX.DLL, was not found"
        and the game won't run.

A:      Most likely, this DLL is a part of DirectX, a Windows component
        that is required to run the game. It comes with the game, and
        the installer would install DirectX, but probably you have
        skipped the installation.

        To do it now, start dxsetup.exe from the root directory of the CD.

Q:      What version of DirectX does the game require?

A:      DirectX version 8. It comes with the game, and the game
        installer would install it, too; but if you skipped the
        installation of DirectX, you can do it by starting dxsetup.exe
        from the root directory of the CD.

Q:      The music does not play.

A:      Make sure you can play mp3-s with Windows Media Player. (It does
        not matter you can play them with any other player). Try to open
        one of the files with mp3 extension with Media Player. If it can
        not, download the latest Windows Media Player from www.microsoft.com
        and install. This will fix the problem with the game, too.

Q:      With steering wheel (or joystick), the truck always goes to the
        left (or right).

A:      Any joystick or steering wheel as well, should be calibrated in Windows.
        For that, find "Game controllers" in Control Panel, click on to it,
        and select your wheel from the list that appears.  Click "Properties",
        then "Calibrate". Follow the instructions.

Q:      What gamma should be set on my accelerator?

A:      The gamma value should be set to 1.0.
        For example, 3dfx default gamma is higher. To set it to 1.0,
        go to your display properties (by right-clicking on your desktop
        and selecting "Properties"), choose "3DFx Voodoo Graphics" tab
        and adjust the sliders to 1.0.
